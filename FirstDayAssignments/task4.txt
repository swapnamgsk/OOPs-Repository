Luggage Weight Limits - Encapsulation:

In travel, luggage weight limits restrict how much you can carry.
In software, encapsulation limits direct access to data. It's like putting your
 belongings in a suitcase, allowing controlled access. You don't want anyone messing 
 with your stuff directly.

Visa Requirements - Abstraction:

Visas are like entry permits for countries.
In software, abstraction hides complex details. Think of it as dealing with the visa office
 instead of understanding every bureaucratic rule. It simplifies interactions.
Flight Booking Rules - Inheritance:

Airlines have specific rules for booking.
Inheritance is like different ticket classes inheriting basic booking rules. 
First class inherits some rules from economy, but it can add or modify them.
Hotel Check-In Time - Polymorphism:

Hotels have different check-in times.
Polymorphism is like adapting to check-in times. You may arrive at a hotel at any time, 
and you adapt your actions accordingly without knowing the specific check-in time until you 
arrive.
