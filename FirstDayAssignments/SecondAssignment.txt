2. Journey Extension: Imagine extending your Swiss journey to neighboring countries. 
How would you adapt your travel checklist? Relate this to the concept of
 inheritance and polymorphism in software design.


 If the Swiss journey extends to neighboring countries, I have to change my chekclist.
 
Inheritance : when it comes to the concept of inheritance , At first my checklist is to visit
the different places in swiss only but now my checklist has extended to visit different places
in other countries also.Our checklist includes on the top the previous checklist.We have to 
pack the things along the things which we have got in swiss. 

Polymorphism: In our travel scenario, polymorphism can be related to the need for adapting 
to different currencies in neighboring countries. We may use the same wallet or travel card 
but need to accommodate multiple currencies, requiring us to dynamically handle and convert 
currencies as needed during our journey.
